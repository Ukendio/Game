/**
 * getVoteOrDefault takes two arguments:
 * - a record of votes sent by clients of type string
 * - a vector of votable options
 * This function will return the last option if no votes were cast into the ballot
 *
 * It does this in 3 main steps:
 *  - 1. Constructs an array of the inferred pairs `LuaTuple<[string, number]>` from the type `Record<string, number>`
 * 	- 2. using an array binding pattern to separate the inferred two-tuples into values to
 * 	  subtract the difference between upper- and lower bound.
 * 	- 3. wrap highest element in option but map to the last index in `votableOptions` if it
 * 	  is of the `None` type
